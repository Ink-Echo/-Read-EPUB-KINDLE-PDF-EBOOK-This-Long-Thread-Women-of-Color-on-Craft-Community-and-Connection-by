Celebrate the diverse work of people of color in the craft community and explore the personal, political, and creative potential of textile arts and crafts.

In early 2019, the craft community experienced a reckoning when crafters of color began sharing personal stories about exclusion and racial injustice in their field, pointing out the inequity and lack of visible diversity within the crafting world. Author Jen Hewett, who is one of a few prominent women of color in the fiber crafts community, now brings together this book as a direct response to the need to highlight the diverse voices of artists working

Review: I absolutely love how well this book is written to define who we are as black women by threading together the fabric of the culture identifies as of women of color through shared stories. I wished my grandmother could have lived long enough to read this book!

Review: This book offered insight into the complexity of being an artist/crafter in a world that champions creativity Only when its acknowledged within the cannon of art majors and museums. It expands our perceptions of what is art and more importantly, who creates it.

Review: I loved the stories and journeys from people that look like me. Our voice is often lost in the mainstream view. I could relate to so many of the stories as if they were my own.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Essays and Interviews With Contemporary Fiber Artists - Interesting Book
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 9, 2022
Review: The author, Jen Hewett is a wonderful artist who has built a successful textile design and licensing business, first in San Francisco and now based in the Hudson Valley. Her design sense is superb. As a longtime fan, I know that any project that she does is going to be worthy of attention. Jen wrote a previous book "Print, Pattern, Sew: Block Printing Basics and Simple Sewing Projects" that every craftsperson should have in their library. Jen's new book "This Long Thread: Women of Color on Craft, Community, and Connection" is exactly what the title promises. Jen dives deep into interviews and surveys with fellow women of color on their art practices, personal histories, challenges and successes. Reading this book led me to many craftswomen that I would not have otherwise found. This is a "reading" book rather than a "picture" book. It is nice to have your computer nearby to look up the artists as you are reading the book to get visuals on examples of their work. I highly recommend this book and anything by this author.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars An Incredible Read; Recommend for All Creatives
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 22, 2022
Review: I have been reading this book nearly daily (which says a lot because I primarily consume audiobooks) and I can't recommend it enough. The format is so easy to enjoy even in small "bite-sized" reading sessions because the interviews and small vignettes that Jen has parceled out are each a gem in their own right. I found myself wanting to go and find each Creative included in the book online so I could dive deeper into more of their work. These stories told in the voices of the designer, maker, crafter, artist are so compelling. I recommend this book for ALL who have interest in learning more about people of color in the creative community. They each have something worth connecting to, and this book presents that beautifully. The questions are well-considered and therefore the interviews are engaging. The survey has so many relatable points that I find myself asking, "how would I answer that?". The essays are so good I will likely go back and read some of them more than once. Thanks to Jen and everyone who contributed to this excellent work.
